# Output Data

The outputs from the data are stored in the ouputs_SEASON folder of the scenario folder. Outputs can be divided into demand model outputs and traffic assignment outputs; these will be discussed next.

## Demand Model Outputs

These files are the outputs from the [resident](ResidentModel.html), [external worker](ExternalWorkers.html) and the [visitor](VisitorModels.html) models. Each of the submodels discussed in the earlier sections produce their own outputs. Many of these outputs are used in performing calibration and model validation; however, they are not typically used in analysing the outputs of a run.

## Traffic Assignment Outputs

These files are outputs from the traffic assignment module. It has the network link volumes and other network related outputs. 

## Report Files

The report files are also generated along with the outputs and various different summaries that can be used by a user to understand the model result.
