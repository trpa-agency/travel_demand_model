</div>


<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Understanding and forecasting visitor travel is an important part of modeling travel demand in the Tahoe basin. The visitor models deals with three types of visitors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Overnight-visitors - those who stay overnight in the region (to include seasonal residents)</p></li>
<li><p>Day-visitors - those who enter and leave the region during the travel day using the same external station</p></li>
<li><p>Thru-visitors - those who enter and leave the region during the travel day using different external stations to enter and exit</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the Tahoe visitor model is provide the analyst with a way to specify the population size, populate the region and then model the travel produced by this population accurately.</p>
<div id="visitor-data-sources-and-visitor" class="section level2">
<h2>Visitor Data Sources and Visitor</h2>
<p>The bulk of the visitor data came from the results of overnight and day-visitor travel surveys produced by NuStats (see “Tahoe_report_final_winter[summer].pdf” for more details) These surveys were taken during both the summer and winter seasons, and attempted to capture the travel behavior of non-residents in the region. Seasonal residents, a population that is modeled along with the overnight-visitors, were surveyed during the resident surveys. It was hard to define exactly what constituted a “seasonal resident” since they come in various forms (2nd home-owners, regular visitors, monthly renters, time share owners, etc.). In the end, the surveyors asked the interviewee if he/she considered him/herself a seasonal resident and if so the data was thus marked. The last data source was external station traffic counts, which were used to help determine the flow of visitors into and out of the region during the travel day.</p>
</div>
<div id="visitor-model-flow" class="section level2">
<h2>Visitor Model Flow</h2>
<p>The basic unit of visitors is the <em>travel party</em>. This is a group of people who travel together throughout the day, each enjoying the same activities. Almost all travel decisions are made at the travel party level, and therefore for this model, travel decisions made at a more granular level (e.g. individual or joint tours from the resident model) were not allowed. As much as possible, the visitor model was kept consistent with the resident model. It is therefore a micro-simulated, activity-based travel demand model. Due to data availability limitations, the overnight and day-visitor models are more sophisticated and detailed than the thru-visitor model. Furthermore, the survey data for the overnight-visitor model was more detailed than the day-visitor, so a large part of the tour models for the day-visitors was combined with the overnight-visitors to create more robust model estimation results.</p>

<div id="OvntVstrPopSyn" class="section level1">
<h1>Overnight-visitor synthetic population</h1>
<p>The overnight-visitor synthetic population is used to represent persons who visit the Tahoe basin on a non-permanent basis (i.e. are not permanent residents) but who are not just visiting for the day. This population includes people who do not claim any residence in the region (<em>vacationers</em>), and also seasonal residents, who own or rent a residence in the region and reside in it on a regular, though not permanent, basis. The synthetic population is micro-simulated using occupancy rates (which can vary by scenario) and actual records from the overnight-visitor survey and residential travel survey. The base unit of the synthetic population is the <em>travel party</em>, which can be considered analogous to the household unit of the residential travel model. The reason overnight-visitors are not referred to as households is two-fold:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Often travel parties may consist of multiple households (both within and across families). Thus, referring to the party as a household (as it is used in other parts of this model/documentation) would be misleading.</p></li>
<li><p>The level of information available for each party is extremely limited: essentially where they stayed and some basic compositional data. The use of the term household - both in terms of the residential model and activity-based models in general - implies a deeper level of data than what is known. The use of the more generic <em>travel party</em> helps to underline this.</p></li>
</ol>
<div id="population-stratification" class="section level2">
<h2>Population Stratification</h2>
<p>The overnight-visitor population is stratified by their <em>stay-type</em>, or the type of accommodation used during their stay. The reason for this is partly due to the observation that people staying at campgrounds make different travel decisions than people staying in a resort hotel than do people staying in a rental cabin for example. In addition, stratifying the population provides the user more control over the overnight-visitor population in a specific scenario.</p>
<p>There are six stay-type stratifications for the overnight-visitor population:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Seasonal - For seasonal residents</p></li>
<li><p>Hotel/Motel - For visitors staying in a hotel or motel</p></li>
<li><p>Casino - For visitors staying in a casino-based hotel</p></li>
<li><p>Resort - For visitors staying in a higher-end (non-casino) resort</p></li>
<li><p>House - For visitors who are not seasonal residents but who are staying in some type of an attached or detached residence</p></li>
<li><p>Campground - For visitors staying at a campsite</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For each of these stay-types, the synthetic population model requires the user to specify the number of units that are occupied on the model day for each zone. These <em>vacancies</em> are then <em>filled</em> by visitor parties during the synthesis procedure. A description of what form the inputs must take and how the information is used to synthesize the population is described below.</p>
<p>For Hotel/Motel, Casino, Resort, and Campground stay-types, the number of available units per zone is a scenario-specific input. The other required input is the occupation percentage, by zone, for each of these stay-types. By multiplying these two values, the number of occupied units is determined. (As a note, the winter Campground occupation rate is globally set to zero, as winter camping rarely, if ever, occurs in the basin).</p>
<p>For the Seasonal and House stay-types, the number of available units is derived from the socio-economic data used in the resident model. That data includes both the number of available housing units and the number of (full-time) occupied units. The difference between these numbers provides the number of units available for the Seasonal and House overnight-visitor stay-types. The user inputs are then the percentages of available units that are filled, and the percentage of those units that are seasonal. From this the number of filled housing units can be determined.</p>
</div>
<div id="sample-source" class="section level2">
<h2>Sample Source</h2>
<p>The synthetic population consists of actual travel parties sampled from the overnight-visitor and resident surveys. This is analogous to the use of the PUMS records to generate the resident synthetic population. Because there were two sources for the population, and because the samples would be merged to form the full overnight-visitor population, the data in the sample from each source had to be identical. Furthermore, the <a href="#DayVstrPopSyn">day visitor population</a> would also be merged with this population later in the model stream, so the limited data collected during the day visitor survey determined what data could be retained/used from all the surveys. The resulting travel party characteristics were used in the models:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>travel party size</p></li>
<li><p>number of children (age &lt; 18) in the party</p></li>
<li><p>presence of an adult female</p></li>
<li><p>stay-type of the party</p></li>
<li><p>season during which the survey was taken (summer, winter, or seasonal for seasonal residents)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the non-seasonal resident overnight-visitors, the overnight-visitor survey records are sampled. For example, when populating campgrounds with overnight-visitors, the sample set is all surveyed visitors that stayed at a campground. However not all of the stay-types had enough survey records to provide a robust sample set and were therefore combined with other stay-types. For the same reasons, stratification by season or location could not be made. Table below summarizes the sample source for each stay-type.</p>

<p>For seasonal-residents, the sample source is the residential household survey. NuStats was able to survey 229 households that self-identified as <em>seasonal</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="population-synthesis" class="section level2">
<h2>Population Synthesis</h2>
<p>Given the number of units to be filled by zone and stay-type, and the sample records corresponding to each stay-type, the population synthesis is a straightforward procedure. For each stay-type unit to be filled in a zone, a travel party is randomly selected from the available population sample records for that stay-type. Along with the sample data described above, the stay location (zone) is recorded and will be used as that travel party’s origin/home TAZ.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="DayVstrPopSyn" class="section level1">
<h1>Day-Visitor Population Synthesis</h1>
<p>The day-visitor synthetic population is used to represent persons who visit the Tahoe basin only for the day and do not stay overnight. Technically this population includes thru-visitors, but as these are handled in a <a href="#ThrgVstrPopSyn">separate model</a>, further restrictions are made: day-visitors are those described above who also make at least one stop and exit the region using the same external station they entered. Like the overnight-visitor population, the day-visitors are micro-simulated using a sample drawn from the day-visitor survey records, and the base decision making unit is again the <em>travel party</em>. However, in contrast to the overnight-visitor population, there is no quantity analogous to occupation rates that can accurately constrain the population size. Instead, external station counts (which day-visitors must be a part of) were used to calibrate the day-visitor population size, which was then indexed to the overnight-visitor population.</p>
<div id="sample-source-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Sample Source</h2>
<p>As described above, the day-visitor synthetic population consists of a sample of actual travel parties from the day-visitor surveys. This is analogous to the use of the PUMS records to generate the resident synthetic population. As described earlier, the day and overnight-visitor populations are merged later in the visitor model stream, and this forced the requirement that the two populations needed to contain equivalent data. As such, the following variables are included in the day-visitor sample records:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The travel party size</p></li>
<li><p>The number of children (age &lt; 18) in the party</p></li>
<li><p>The season during which the survey was taken (summer or winter)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As a note, the presence of an adult female in the travel party variable included in the overnight-visitor population was not available from the day-visitor survey. However, this variable is not used once the two populations are merged, and therefore its elimination does not affect the model. From the day-visitor survey, 597 sample records were put together to form the day-visitor sample set.</p>
</div>
<div id="day-visitor-rates" class="section level2">
<h2>Day-visitor Rates</h2>
<p>To synthesize the day-visitor population, the number of day-visitors originating at each external station must be known. To determine this, external station counts (in each direction) for the base scenario and model results from the residential and external worker models are used. Subtracting the residential and external worker trips which use the external stations from the external station counts gives the amount of flow that the day-visitor and thru visitor trips must make up. During validation, the split between the day-visitor and thru visitor trips is determined and, given this, the specific number of day-visitors per external station is known for the base scenario. To make the day-visitors vary when running forecast scenarios, two assumptions are made:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>That the day-visitors rise and fall at the same rate that overnight-visitors do; that is, that the number of day-visitors is a function of the number of overnight-visitors</p></li>
<li><p>That the distribution of day-visitors between the external stations is constant across scenarios</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Assumption 2 is probably more controversial and less <em>realistic</em> than 1, but it is required as there is little to no information as to what drives the day-visitor external station distributions</p>
<p>Given the above assumptions, the number of day-visitors for each external station is calculated using a simple linear formula:</p>
<p>D<sub>e</sub> = O<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span><sub>e</sub></p>
<p>where D<sub>e</sub> is the number of day-visitors coming in through external station e<br />
O is the number of overnight-visitors<br />
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span><sub>e</sub> is the day-visitor rate factor for external station e</p>
<p>The values for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span><sub>e</sub> are given in Tables below for the two seasons. Summing all of the rate factors shows that the number of day-visitors is roughly equal to 78% of the number of overnight-visitors for the summer, and 58% for the winter.</p>

<h1>Population Synthesis</h1>
<p>Given the number of day-visitor travel parties per external station, and the day-visitor survey sample records, generating the day-visitor synthetic population is a straightforward procedure. Essentially, for each external station, a travel party is randomly selected from the available day-visitor sample records until the required number of parties is achieved. Along with the sample data described above, the external station is recorded and will be used as that travel party’s origin/home TAZ.</p>

<div id="VisitorDAP" class="section level1">
<h1>Overnight and Day-Visitor DAP Models</h1>
<p>The daily activity pattern for visitors describes the travel behavior for travel parties. The outputs of this model are the number of tours made, the tour type, and how many stops were made during the tour. The overnight and day-visitor daily activity pattern models are run separately, but they share the same overall structure and so are discussed together.</p>
<div id="daily-activity-pattern-alternatives" class="section level2">
<h2>Daily Activity Pattern Alternatives</h2>
<p>For both the day-visitor and overnight-visitor daily activity pattern models, a set of possible daily activity patterns has been specified. These were selected from the patterns found in the overnight and day-visitor surveys. Each pattern begins and ends at the <em>home</em> or external station location (H) and can have at most one stop going to and one stop coming from the primary destination.</p>
<p>There are 4 main tour types - recreation, gaming, shopping, and other. Each pattern specifies how many tours (H x H x H = 2 tours), the primary purpose and the number of stops that occur in the party’s daily travel. For example, the pattern “HOHTGH” says that the travel party left home to participate in an <em>other</em> activity and went back home (HOH). Later the same day, the same travel party made a quick stop (T) on the way to a <em>gaming</em> activity (G) before returning directly home (H). Because day-visitors are not staying in the region, their daily activity patterns consist of only one tour. The abbreviations used in the patterns for each of the destinations are described in table below.</p>

<h1>Visitor Tour DTM Models</h1>
<p>For each tour in a travel party’s pattern, the visitor tour destination, time-of-day, and mode choice model (DTM) determines where that tour will go (the destination), when the tour will happen (the time-of-day), and how the person will travel during the tour (the mode). When the model is applied, each travel party is treated as a separate and independent decision making unit. The order that the DTM model is applied to each tour in the travel party’s daily activity pattern is the same as the order in the pattern.</p>

<h2>Destination Choice Sub-model</h2>
<p>The destination choice model is a multinomial logit model in which each potential destination zone is an alternative. Each zone’s attractiveness is calculated from a utility function, where the utility consists of variables such as distance, stay-type, and area type.<br />
To provide a measure of a zone’s attractiveness based on tour-specific characteristics, a size term is included in the utility expression. The size terms are stratified by tour type and are calculated as the natural logarithm (ln) of a sum of variables. Also included in the utility expression is the logsum from the mode choice model, which provides an index of accessibilities for a destination zone.</p>

<h2>Mode Choice Sub-model</h2>

<p>The shuttle mode represents tour buses and commercial shuttles. Day-visitors are assumed to use the drive mode. The primary component of the mode choice model is travel time, which uses the same coefficient across all modes. For the modes that have costs associated with them (transit has fares, auto modes have operating costs), a value of time factor was estimated; this factor converts dollar costs into time, for which a utility can be calculated using the travel time coefficient.</p>

<h1>Visitor Tour Stop Model</h1>
<p>Each visitor tour may have up to two stops: an outbound stop and an inbound stop. The determination of whether or not stops are made on a given tour is made in the visitor pattern model: for each tour, the presence of an inbound and/or outbound stop is fixed by the pattern structure. The visitor stops model concerns itself with choosing the location and mode of each tour stop. The time-of-day choice for the stop is pre-determined by the time-of-day choice for the tour that the stop occurs in. The stop location and mode choice models treat each stop independently.</p>
<p>The stop location choice model is a multinomial logit model in which each potential destination zone is an alternative. The model is partially stratified by season. Each zone’s attractiveness is calculated from a utility function, where the utility consists of zonal and travel-party specific information. The distance the stop adds to the overall tour distance is used as a penalty in the utility. This penalty is calculated as both the absolute (actual) difference and relative difference, the latter of which is the absolute difference divided by the tour distance without the stop.</p>
<p>To provide a measure of a zone’s attractiveness based on tour-specific characteristics, a size term is included in the utility expression. The size terms are stratified by season and are calculated as the natural logarithm of a sum of variables.</p>
<p>The stop mode choice model is used to determine if certain tour legs should be non-motorized. For a tour half (outbound or inbound), the mode choice model takes the shortest leg (to the stop or from the stop) and compares the travel time of the tour mode versus the walk mode. The mode with the shorter travel time is the one assigned to that leg. For tour modes other than non-motorized or walk-to-transit, only the second leg for outbound trips (from the stop) or the first leg for inbound trips (to the stop) can be walk to transit or non-motorized. The first and last trip must be the previously chosen tour mode.</p>

<h1>Thru-Visitor Population Synthesis</h1>
<p>Thru-visitors are persons or parties that travel into the Tahoe basin through an external stationb but do not stop and they leave through a different external station. These “visitors” include not only recreational travel, but also commercial traffic. Because of their transient nature, very little information about this population is known; its existence can generally only be inferred through traffic count analysis. In spite of these limitations, a simple, disaggregate approach was developed to model the flow of thru-visitors. This was done both for flexibility and to remain consistent with the other population travel demand models. The model flow follows that used for the other models: first a population is synthesized, then a destination is chosen, and finally a time-of-day for the tour/trip is chosen.</p>
<div id="population-synthesis-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Population Synthesis</h2>
<p>The population synthesis for the thru-visitor population is very simple and closely tied to the day-visitor population synthesis. Essentially, the number of thru-visitors originating at each external station is indexed to the number of overnight-visitors in the region in the scenario. This implies that there is a linear relationship between the number of overnight-visitors and the number of thru-visitors on any given day. The formula for calculating the number of thru-visitors is:</p>
<p>T<sub>e</sub> = O<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span><sub>e</sub></p>
<p>where T<sub>e</sub> is the number of thru-visitors coming in through external station e<br />
O is the number of overnight-visitors <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span><sub>e</sub> is the thru-visitor rate factor for external station e</p>
<p>The rate factors were initially set such that the number of thru-visitors equals 2% of overnight-visitors. These factors changed slightly as the model was validated against external counts.</p>
